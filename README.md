# CIISCO

CMEs Identification in Inner Solar Corona (CIISCO) based on [Patel et al. 2021](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11207-021-01770-z) is an automated method to detected and characterize the eruptions in the inner corona. It is in the process to upgrade to be used for the inner-middle corona for automated detection and hence CISCO. This is very preliminary version which we tested in Solar Orbiter Full Sun Imager dataset and needs improvement to be used as an operational tool.
